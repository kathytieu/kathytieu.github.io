				<br><a href="https://www.proteus.com/">Proteus Discover</a> is a Digital Medicine offering that measures medication treatment effectiveness and helps physicians improve clinical outcomes.
				<p>For healthcare providers that regularly interface with patients, Patient Progress Report reduces the effort needed to utilize the system by curating the essential information needed into a quickread and accessible format. </p>

			<h2>For Clinical Pharmacists Treating High-Touch Patients</h2>
			<p>Our target audience are clinical pharmacists that have frequent check-ins with their patients. They can have 10 to 15 in-person visits and follow up calls a day, with very little time in between each patient to review and understand their data before having a conversation with them.</p>
			<div class="spacersmall"></div>
			<img src="/assets/progressreport/schedule.png" width="100%">
			<div class="spacersmall"></div>
			<p>They have approximately 15 minutes to review their patient’s entire history on an electronic medical record (EMR) and other platforms. We then ask them to review our data:</p>

			<h2>"That’s a lot of data.. I already don’t have enough time. Is it worth it?"</h2>
			<p>Clinical pharmacists are initially excited when they learn how medication adherence can be measured and correlated to patient biometrics. It makes the medication’s effects clear.</p>
			<p>However, they soon realize the burden and complexity in doing something new: prescribing and interpreting Proteus data. For being time consuming with a steep learning curve, this cost feels too high for their already busy days.</p>

			<h2>The Physician Mental Model</h2>
			<p>Card sort excercises performed by physicians revealed the "mental script" they go through when speaking to a patient. This acted as a blueprint for the page architecture.</p>

			<h2>Insights and Recommendations</h2>
			<p>Through customer feedback and testing, we saw that novel adherence data took a lot of time to understand. This makes it difficult to action upon the data.</p>
			<p>An insight is a quick, intuitive interpretation of objective data. Recommendations are actionable statements that act as a guideline for next steps.</p>

				<h2>We received overwhelmingly positive feedback.</h2>
				
				<p>A usability study showed that a clinical pharmacist that has never heard of Proteus Discover successfully interpretted and actioned upon a Patient Progress Report in under two minutes through a role play excercise.</p>

				<p>Existing customers were impressed by its value and looked forwards to being able to improve their workflow.</p>

				<p>Its unique medium also allowed us to experiment and be creative with how we can solve problems on the main Web Portal. We look forwards to seeing how we can be apply our learnings to the whole Proteus Discover system.</p>
